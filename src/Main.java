//	とりあえず、どんな問題を解決するかきめよう！

//-------------------------------------------------------
//	1. FIRST PROBLEM
//	Solve "not enough change" problem, with the downward count math
//	# use the bigest bill can hand back to customer first than the small bills will come after
//	# With this way, small bill will me minimun use
//	# To be more advance
//		-> put in a notification whenever the bill left is under a certain amount
//		-> notification if the change is not enough to hand back to customer


//-------------------------------------------------------
//	2. SECOND PROBLEM
//	Canceling come when the rush hour arrive!

//	#Queue list will need to be implement for customer oder
//	-> Customer class
//		- Bill number
//		- Food list
//		- Time order (To calculate the time and display on the recipt for customer to know how long will it take)


// 	#To solve and minimize returning, Put in queue and display it on the screen
//	so customer can know exact how long they will have to wait

//	# Numer Queue	(is this needed?)
//	-> display number queue how many order left!
//	-> currently which order is called?


//	# Time Queue
//	->	how much compacity the steamer can hold
//	-> 	is there is available room for the current customer order?	
//	-> after all the observation, time queue will be shown in font of the cashier so the customer can decide
//	whether buy or not!
